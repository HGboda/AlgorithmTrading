# stock-quantitative-development, Algorithm Trading

This is Quantitative Algorithm Trading System and this system has web scraping, Data management, Data Analysis(Big Data, Machine Learning, Stock simulation Result).

A. Data Scraping
-----------------
A simulAuto function gathers 1750 stock data from Quandl and Yahooâ€™s Data Server and this function runs simultaneously with parallel processing architecture supported by IPython APIs.
